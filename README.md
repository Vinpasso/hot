The High Dimensional Exploration and Optimization Tool (HOT) is a tool for visualizing and comparing software performance on CPU/GPU hybrid architectures.
HOT uses Intel's Offload Advisor to model application performance, allowing it to create performance predictions for real and fantasy accelerator architectures without porting application source code.

### Documentation
For more information, please refer to the associated paper "On the Exploration and Optimization of High-Dimensional Architectural Design-Space".

### Demo
To try HOT please use the following link: [https://caps-tum.github.io/hot/all_config_explorer.html](https://caps-tum.github.io/hot/all_config_explorer.html). 
It contains sample data collected at the Chair for Computer Architecture using Offload Advisor 2021.1.
